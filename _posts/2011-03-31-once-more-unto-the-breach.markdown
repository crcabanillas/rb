It's been quite a while since I was active on the web. There have been tweets but it hasn't been the same. On a number of occasions I wanted to say something but didn't simply because 140 characters just wasn't enough. I kept mum.Â Frankly, it doesn't matter if you missed my additions to the cacophony.

I missed them.

I am the content
----------------

In the past, even at my most gregarious, I held back on certain types of posts because of a concern that my readers were uninterested in this or that topic. I had an idea who my readers were and I catered very carefully to them. This would often lead to dry spells when my attention wandered to areas far off the path that restiffbard.com had beaten out for itself. If I was suddenly interested in something I didn't feel my audience would care about then posting would slow or simply stop for weeks or months at a time.

That won't be the case for this go-round.

where things stand
------------------

This is a clean slate. If you're looking for old entries you simply won't find them. They exist. They're in a file backed up somewhere. They're just not here. If you're reading this the day I'm posting it then the appearance of this page is stock Wordpress. That'll change one can assume.

I'm rusty. I've not kept up to date. I know there is an HTML 5. I have no idea if/how/what/why to do anything with that. I'm older. I have to jog my memory by looking at old template files from previous incarnations of restiffbard.com and glean what I can from them.

I've bounced around from one CMS to another. Wordpress, Drupal, ExpressionEngine, and others whose names I can't recall. They've been written in PHP, Perl, Ruby. They've all had their own way of templating things and it's all a jumble in my head now.

It will take some time to work out the kinks.

what is to come
---------------

More. Look for commentary on the web and Apple and Google and others. That I've always done. Look for tips and tricks. I've done a spot of that in the past as well. Also, look for me talking about games. I'd always talked about music and film in the past but I left out my baser addiction to games. It wasn't for this audience. I forgot that I was a member of that audience.

I'll also talk more about my writing. I not only write these bits here but I, like nearly everyone else, have authorial aspirations. I need to talk about that too. Whole worlds live in my head and I'd like to offer you a peak at them if only to be able to get away, for one more day, with being completely insane and yet not in an asylum.

what have we learned
--------------------

For starters, I'm back. Though I was never really gone. I had been creeping about on the periphery. It's high time I stepped back on the stage. I've also forgotten some things. I've forgotten some markup, some styling. My memory will get me lost poking around the innards of a template these days. The most important thing I forgot, though, was the following.

I forgot I'm a blogger.
