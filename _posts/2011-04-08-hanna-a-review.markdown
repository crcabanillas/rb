[Saoirse Ronan][] is _[Hanna][]_. Not knowing if there was ever another contender for the role you can't imagine anyone else playing this character. Raised in the forest to be something of a killing machine she is set to avenge her mother's murder.

Honestly, that's all the plot you really need know. Normally I'd tip-toe around spoilers but there's no need. [Cate Blanchett][]'s character is bad. Saoirse's (I'm enjoying trying to remember how to spell that name) character is out for revenge because that's what she's been raised to do. Plot, done.

The reason to see the film is more about the way in which this story we've all read or seen before is presented. [Joe Wright][] previously directed Saoirse in _[Atonement][]_, a very different tragedy-romance period film set against a World War II backdrop. Hanna is not his sort of story and he reportedly only took the job because Saoirse told him to. Lucky for us.

Despite the assassin nature of the character Wright focuses more on her reaction to the world around her than her fighting prowess. Often fight scenes are flurries of jump cuts resulting in a pile of bodies. Far more interest is shown the first time Hanna encounters a fluorescent light fixture and does battle with an electric kettle. Wright does a wonderful job of creating lovely scenes in snow and desert and cramped camper vans.

Saoirse is brilliant at doing the child-like wonder thing and then switching instantly to the psychopathic murderess thing. She's also quite the runner. I imagine she spent a great amount of time out of breath on set.

[Eric Bana][] manages to be "Eric Bana" without getting in the way of the real star, Saoirse, being Hanna. I can think of a few other actors that would have failed at this simple task.

Cate Blanchett is an actor I adore in anything she does. Cate could sit in a chair reading a telephone directory and be certain of my rapt attention. Cate manages to be a woman while doing traditionally evil male things. That may sound silly but I've found it rare that any evil female character is portrayed as anything other than a man in a woman's skin.

I have to mention the accents now. Saoirse is Irish. Blanchett and Bana are both Aussies. If you'd never seen them in another film before this one you wouldn't believe me. Saoirse's talent for accent is admirable. I'm afraid, though, that Cate's use of a southern American drawl is an exaggerated mask and from time to time you can hear her falling out of it. Bana could probably apply for German citizenship and no one would bat an eye.

We're well into an age now where talking about a film without talking about the soundtrack would be only half a review. The Chemical Brothers have created a score as frenzied, jarring, and lovely (in equal parts) as the film itself. There are, of course, beeps and bloops and other electronic bits scattered among the thumping beats but there are also serene lullabic pieces as well. 

Considering my recent re-viewing of last years _Tron Legacy_ and the frequency with which Daft Punk's soundtrack for that film appears in my playlist I can't help but compare. Each fits the film they accompany but Daft Punk's Tron is more likely to get play time than will the Chemical Brothers' Hanna. That said, I think that if you already enjoy the Chemical Brothers as I do then you'd be happy to add this soundtrack to your library.

Lastly, I have to say a word for the foley artist. The ambient sound in this film plays such a huge role. I can't divide the film into equal parts of directing, sound design, acting, etcetera but not to mention the impact of incidental sound in Hanna would be a mistake.

I enjoyed the film. I think that if you're interested in seeing a pretty girl eviscerate a grown man then you will as well. Just don't go expecting to see blood and guts at every turn. This isn't that film.
