title: Reconstruction

I know it's been some time since I was active at this... url. That's changing but part of that change is a complete rebuild of the site. This has more to do with the backend than it does with the front.

OK, sure, this page doesn't quite look like what you might remember but the text.css is exactly the same. So...well... there's that. Once everything is in proper working order I'll do a more detailed "what the heck did I do" post. Till then I'll just say it's Jekyll and Markdown and super simple.

In the meantime expect that when I have a spare day I'll be working on the CSS and various other layout bits here and there and generally making things spiffy again.
