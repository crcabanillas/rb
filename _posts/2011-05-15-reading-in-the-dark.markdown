I just finished reading _Storm Front_ the first book in the Dresden Files series by Jim Butcher. I won't go into the merits of the book. I'll just say, I enjoyed it a great deal and wish I'd read it years ago and that I'll probably have the second book by this time tomorrow.

What I wanted to focus on was the manner in which I read the book. I knew of the Dresden Files series for some time, at least since the premiere of the television series on Sci-Fi (back when it was called that). Still, I didn't get around to reading the book until my memory was jogged seeing Jim Butcher's name go by at. That was enough to have me seek out the series on Netflix. For the next few days I watched at least one or two episodes each night before sleeping.

That wasn't enough, though. Next stop, Amazon. Thankfully, the Dresden series is available in full for the Kindle. Nothing makes it more likely I will buy your book than Kindle availability. I don't have anything against paper books. I simply don't have the room. If you could see the monk-like cell I live in you'd wonder how I manage at all.

I don't use the Kindle device though I own a second generation Kindle. I prefer to use the app for iOS. My reasoning is simple. I can read a few pages during breaks at work on my phone. I know there are folks that say reading on a phone is painful or horrid or just something else unpleasant. I'm not one of those people. Oh, and my iPhone? It's the first generation, the original iPhone. No retina display for me, no sir.

So, the last few days I've been reading the book mostly at work. Tonight, the story had just gotten too compelling. I had to read it through so I curled up in bed with my iPad and kept on reading. I'm not going to put a lot of stake in the fact that I was reading a book titled _Storm Front_ while a thunder storm was banging away outside.

Here's the interesting thing, by the glow of my iPad and with my attention so taken by the story, I failed to notice that the power had gone out.
