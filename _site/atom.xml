			<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t expect that it&amp;#8217;s a stunning revelation to any person reading this that Apple&amp;#8217;s Lion operating system launched the other day. It should also be no surprise that I&amp;#8217;m something of an Apple fan (loathe though I am to use that word). I don&amp;#8217;t know what power Apple has over me. I&amp;#8217;m unfamiliar with their Voodoo machinations. I simply accept that the Apple way is very much inline with the Chris way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updating to Lion tested that allegiance. This will be that story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I&amp;#8217;ll make clear that my issues were entirely of my own making. I know better than to do the things I did. That doesn&amp;#8217;t alleviate some of the guilt that Lion&amp;#8217;s installer should have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a normal working day I crawl out of bed around ten or eleven in the morning. On the day of Lion&amp;#8217;s launch, despite having gone to sleep around two in the morning, I woke at 8AM. By 8:29AM Heilemann had tweeted a direct link to Lion in the Mac App Store. I will not deny a certain cheer may have escaped my lips. I was downloading Lion in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='regarding_the_pipe'&gt;regarding the pipe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been some mentions of the cost of upgrading to Lion via the Mac App Store. I&amp;#8217;m speaking of something other than the $29.99 sticker price. In this instance I&amp;#8217;m referring to the bandwidth and time spent downloading. For some on metered bandwidth plans four gigabytes is pushing it. You have my condolences. Those more concerned with the time it would take to download 4 gigs need to get a grip. I&amp;#8217;m not on some fat pipe here. I&amp;#8217;m using the basic cable internet plan available to me. At times I get 5 Mbps down. On occasion there&amp;#8217;s a spike to 8 Mbps. I&amp;#8217;m not breaking any speed barriers here. Lion took 44 minutes to download. It took me longer to read John Siracusa&amp;#8217;s review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time it took to download Lion will come up again soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='too_eager_for_my_own_good'&gt;too eager for my own good&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have installation rituals. Some of them involved waving the corpse of a dead chicken. Some throw bones and divine the results. Others do things like backup their data. Then, there&amp;#8217;s me. Me? I just click, click, continue, agree, agree, click, continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t be me. Try the dead chicken waving if anything but don&amp;#8217;t be me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lion installer spent about three minutes getting itself ready before announcing it was ready to reboot. Upon rebooting it announced it would be about 33 minutes before the new OS was installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='thirtytwo_minutes_to_go'&gt;thirty-two minutes to go&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A minute later I was looking at a yellow triangle. Fancy. Along with the yellow triangle (I almost wrote &amp;#8220;concomitant&amp;#8221; there but thought better of it) was a bit of dialogue explaining there was an issue with my hard disk and that it could not be repaired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t start to sweat for roughly three seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#8217;ve begun the Lion installation your Snow Leopard install might as well never existed for all the access you have to it. You can&amp;#8217;t just reboot to your old system. Your disk no longer appears in the system chooser at boot time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='fix'&gt;fix&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I should have done this beforehand. For that matter, the Lion installer should have done this earlier as well. I&amp;#8217;m speaking of Disk Utility. At this point, the only way to run Disk Utility on my funky hard disk was to use my old Snow Leopard install disc. Did I forget to mention that I hadn&amp;#8217;t made a bootable install disc of Lion? Oh, yeah, you should probably do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No problem, just restart the Mac and do some keyboard kung-fu to boot to the optical drive. Yeah&amp;#8230; My kung-fu is weak. The drive wouldn&amp;#8217;t open. I&amp;#8217;ve also failed to mention that particular optical drive has been flaky for years. Who the hell uses an optical drive anymore anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s fine, I managed. The trick was, embarrassingly for everyone involved, booting to my Windows install and opening the optical drive there. Yeah. Revel in this revelation. I had to use Windows to get Lion installed. Embarrassing for me because, really, it just is. Embarrassing for Apple cause their shit didn&amp;#8217;t work perfectly out of the gate. Embarrassing for Microsoft in that I used their OS as a way to open a drive tray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='what_data_where'&gt;what data? where?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t even think on it when Disk Utility reported something about misbehaved nodes. Perhaps, &amp;#8220;misbehaved&amp;#8221; isn&amp;#8217;t the word it used but I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure &amp;#8220;node&amp;#8221; was in there somewhere. While I&amp;#8217;m certain there&amp;#8217;s a recovery program out there somewhere that can handle this sort of thing with aplomb and a six hour wait I just barreled on. Disk Utility offered one solution, format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fine, I formatted the drive. Recall what I said about the folks that backup their data? Recall, also, that I&amp;#8217;m not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take your hand from your agape mouth. It won&amp;#8217;t end that badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='two_birds'&gt;two birds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was reinstalling Snow Leopard to my now empty disk I broke out the Macbook. Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s right, Macbook. The Black Macbook, bitches. That&amp;#8217;s just how I roll. I had the Macbook downloading Lion, again, in a minute. This day was already well shot. I didn&amp;#8217;t see any reason to make it longer by waiting until the Mac Pro had Snow Leopard installed before re-downloading Lion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snow Leopard finished on the Mac Pro a few minutes before Lion finished downloading on the Macbook. I whiled away those ten minutes taking a shower in a feeble attempt to wash away my shame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='insert_irony_here'&gt;insert irony here&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to get the Lion installer from the Macbook to the Mac Pro? There&amp;#8217;s lots of options. For one, I could make that install disc I failed to make the first time around. I could make a quick run to Walmart and pick up a memory stick. Or, here&amp;#8217;s where you&amp;#8217;re gonna laugh, I could copy the Lion installer to my Time Capsule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know. I have a Time Capsule. No, no, I don&amp;#8217;t have any backups on the Time Capsule. Of course, I don&amp;#8217;t. I mean, I do, now. Of course I do, now. But, then? No, not then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I copied the Lion installer around and shortly thereafter I was well past the thirty-two minutes to go mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='rawr'&gt;rawr&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lion was now installed. On a completely bare machine. If I had you fretting earlier when I mentioned the whole no backups, format the drive thing I apologize. All was not lost. The first thing I did once Lion had launched was to fire up Safari and grab the Dropbox client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t, apparently, use Dropbox like everyone else. I have a basic free account with 2.5 gigs of storage. Thus far I&amp;#8217;ve used up 6.2% of that. It&amp;#8217;s all text files. I&amp;#8217;ll do the math for you. That&amp;#8217;s 158.72 megabytes. All of it basic ASCII text. When I mention I&amp;#8217;m a writer it&amp;#8217;s that 158.72 megabytes I&amp;#8217;m thinking of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some losses though. No, not music or movies this time. Those were all safe on a separate hard disk. I did lose all the metadata associated with those media bits, however. I&amp;#8217;m talking star ratings and play counts. Things like that. iTunes now assures me I have 127 unwatched movies (I re-watched Star Trek last night) and 1909 unwatched episodes of television. Fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t lose things like addresses or bookmarks (not that I have any to begin with) or calendars or preferences or anything like that. Laugh all you like but I&amp;#8217;ve used every dollar of my subscription to Mobile Me over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did lose all of my fonts. I lost a lot of fonts by the way. A lot. Oh, and the desktop backgrounds which is why I&amp;#8217;m staring at Andromeda as I write this. Also, all my apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not concerned about the apps. In a way, it&amp;#8217;s a blessing. With a fresh OS I can now re-install apps as I find a need for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='lesson_learned'&gt;lesson learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What have I learned from all this? A few things. I don&amp;#8217;t blame Apple for my hardships. This was as clear cut a case of PEBKAC as any I&amp;#8217;ve seen in years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run Disk Utility&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Backup&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Verify steps 1 and 2&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Wave dead chicken&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this dissection of my failure was in some schadenfreudian way entertaining. More importantly I hope it was educational. Let not my mistakes be your own undoing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;OK, sure, this page doesn&amp;#8217;t quite look like what you might remember but the text.css is exactly the same. So&amp;#8230;well&amp;#8230; there&amp;#8217;s that. Once everything is in proper working order I&amp;#8217;ll do a more detailed &amp;#8220;what the heck did I do&amp;#8221; post. Till then I&amp;#8217;ll just say it&amp;#8217;s Jekyll and Markdown and super simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime expect that when I have a spare day I&amp;#8217;ll be working on the CSS and various other layout bits here and there and generally making things spiffy again.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<title>Hanna</title>
			<link href="/hanna/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" />
			<updated>2011-04-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
			<id>/hanna</id>
			<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1519680/' title='IMDB profile'&gt;Saoirse Ronan&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993842/' title='Hanna at IMDB'&gt;Hanna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Not knowing if there was ever another contender for the role you can&amp;#8217;t imagine anyone else playing this character. Raised in the forest to be something of a killing machine she is set to avenge her mother&amp;#8217;s murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, that&amp;#8217;s all the plot you really need know. Normally I&amp;#8217;d tip-toe around spoilers but there&amp;#8217;s no need. &lt;a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000949/' title='IMDB profile'&gt;Cate Blanchett&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8217;s character is bad. Saoirse&amp;#8217;s (I&amp;#8217;m enjoying trying to remember how to spell that name) character is out for revenge because that&amp;#8217;s what she&amp;#8217;s been raised to do. Plot, done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason to see the film is more about the way in which this story we&amp;#8217;ve all read or seen before is presented. &lt;a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0942504/' title='IMDB profile'&gt;Joe Wright&lt;/a&gt; previously directed Saoirse in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0783233/' title='Atonement at IMDB'&gt;Atonement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a very different tragedy-romance period film set against a World War II backdrop. Hanna is not his sort of story and he reportedly only took the job because Saoirse told him to. Lucky for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the assassin nature of the character Wright focuses more on her reaction to the world around her than her fighting prowess. Often fight scenes are flurries of jump cuts resulting in a pile of bodies. Far more interest is shown the first time Hanna encounters a fluorescent light fixture and does battle with an electric kettle. Wright does a wonderful job of creating lovely scenes in snow and desert and cramped camper vans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saoirse is brilliant at doing the child-like wonder thing and then switching instantly to the psychopathic murderess thing. She&amp;#8217;s also quite the runner. I imagine she spent a great amount of time out of breath on set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0051509/' title='IMDB profile'&gt;Eric Bana&lt;/a&gt; manages to be &amp;#8220;Eric Bana&amp;#8221; without getting in the way of the real star, Saoirse, being Hanna. I can think of a few other actors that would have failed at this simple task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cate Blanchett is an actor I adore in anything she does. Cate could sit in a chair reading a telephone directory and be certain of my rapt attention. Cate manages to be a woman while doing traditionally evil male things. That may sound silly but I&amp;#8217;ve found it rare that any evil female character is portrayed as anything other than a man in a woman&amp;#8217;s skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to mention the accents now. Saoirse is Irish. Blanchett and Bana are both Aussies. If you&amp;#8217;d never seen them in another film before this one you wouldn&amp;#8217;t believe me. Saoirse&amp;#8217;s talent for accent is admirable. I&amp;#8217;m afraid, though, that Cate&amp;#8217;s use of a southern American drawl is an exaggerated mask and from time to time you can hear her falling out of it. Bana could probably apply for German citizenship and no one would bat an eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re well into an age now where talking about a film without talking about the soundtrack would be only half a review. The Chemical Brothers have created a score as frenzied, jarring, and lovely (in equal parts) as the film itself. There are, of course, beeps and bloops and other electronic bits scattered among the thumping beats but there are also serene lullabic pieces as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering my recent re-viewing of last years &lt;em&gt;Tron Legacy&lt;/em&gt; and the frequency with which Daft Punk&amp;#8217;s soundtrack for that film appears in my playlist I can&amp;#8217;t help but compare. Each fits the film they accompany but Daft Punk&amp;#8217;s Tron is more likely to get play time than will the Chemical Brothers&amp;#8217; Hanna. That said, I think that if you already enjoy the Chemical Brothers as I do then you&amp;#8217;d be happy to add this soundtrack to your library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have to say a word for the foley artist. The ambient sound in this film plays such a huge role. I can&amp;#8217;t divide the film into equal parts of directing, sound design, acting, etcetera but not to mention the impact of incidental sound in Hanna would be a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the film. I think that if you&amp;#8217;re interested in seeing a pretty girl eviscerate a grown man then you will as well. Just don&amp;#8217;t go expecting to see blood and guts at every turn. This isn&amp;#8217;t that film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hanna, April 2011&lt;br /&gt;Starring: &lt;a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1519680/' title='IMDB profile'&gt;Saoirse Ronan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000949/' title='IMDB profile'&gt;Cate Blanchett&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0051509/' title='IMDB profile'&gt;Eric Bana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director: &lt;a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0942504/' title='IMDB profile'&gt;Joe Wright&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<title>Once More Unto the Breach</title>
			<link href="/once-more-unto-the-breach/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" />
			<updated>2011-03-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
			<id>/once-more-unto-the-breach</id>
			<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been quite a while since I was active on the web. There have been tweets but it hasn&amp;#8217;t been the same. On a number of occasions I wanted to say something but didn&amp;#8217;t simply because 140 characters just wasn&amp;#8217;t enough. I kept mum. Frankly, it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter if you missed my additions to the cacophony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I missed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='i_am_the_content'&gt;I am the content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, even at my most gregarious, I held back on certain types of posts because of a concern that my readers were uninterested in this or that topic. I had an idea who my readers were and I catered very carefully to them. This would often lead to dry spells when my attention wandered to areas far off the path that restiffbard.com had beaten out for itself. If I was suddenly interested in something I didn&amp;#8217;t feel my audience would care about then posting would slow or simply stop for weeks or months at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That won&amp;#8217;t be the case for this go-round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='where_things_stand'&gt;where things stand&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a clean slate. If you&amp;#8217;re looking for old entries you simply won&amp;#8217;t find them. They exist. They&amp;#8217;re in a file backed up somewhere. They&amp;#8217;re just not here. If you&amp;#8217;re reading this the day I&amp;#8217;m posting it then the appearance of this page is stock Wordpress. That&amp;#8217;ll change one can assume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m rusty. I&amp;#8217;ve not kept up to date. I know there is an HTML 5. I have no idea if/how/what/why to do anything with that. I&amp;#8217;m older. I have to jog my memory by looking at old template files from previous incarnations of restiffbard.com and glean what I can from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve bounced around from one CMS to another. Wordpress, Drupal, ExpressionEngine, and others whose names I can&amp;#8217;t recall. They&amp;#8217;ve been written in PHP, Perl, Ruby. They&amp;#8217;ve all had their own way of templating things and it&amp;#8217;s all a jumble in my head now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will take some time to work out the kinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='what_is_to_come'&gt;what is to come&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More. Look for commentary on the web and Apple and Google and others. That I&amp;#8217;ve always done. Look for tips and tricks. I&amp;#8217;ve done a spot of that in the past as well. Also, look for me talking about games. I&amp;#8217;d always talked about music and film in the past but I left out my baser addiction to games. It wasn&amp;#8217;t for this audience. I forgot that I was a member of that audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll also talk more about my writing. I not only write these bits here but I, like nearly everyone else, have authorial aspirations. I need to talk about that too. Whole worlds live in my head and I&amp;#8217;d like to offer you a peak at them if only to be able to get away, for one more day, with being completely insane and yet not in an asylum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='what_have_we_learned'&gt;what have we learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, I&amp;#8217;m back. Though I was never really gone. I had been creeping about on the periphery. It&amp;#8217;s high time I stepped back on the stage. I&amp;#8217;ve also forgotten some things. I&amp;#8217;ve forgotten some markup, some styling. My memory will get me lost poking around the innards of a template these days. The most important thing I forgot, though, was the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I forgot I&amp;#8217;m a blogger.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
