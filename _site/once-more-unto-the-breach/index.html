			<p>It&#8217;s been quite a while since I was active on the web. There have been tweets but it hasn&#8217;t been the same. On a number of occasions I wanted to say something but didn&#8217;t simply because 140 characters just wasn&#8217;t enough. I kept mum.Â Frankly, it doesn&#8217;t matter if you missed my additions to the cacophony.</p>

<p>I missed them.</p>

<h2 id='i_am_the_content'>I am the content</h2>

<p>In the past, even at my most gregarious, I held back on certain types of posts because of a concern that my readers were uninterested in this or that topic. I had an idea who my readers were and I catered very carefully to them. This would often lead to dry spells when my attention wandered to areas far off the path that restiffbard.com had beaten out for itself. If I was suddenly interested in something I didn&#8217;t feel my audience would care about then posting would slow or simply stop for weeks or months at a time.</p>

<p>That won&#8217;t be the case for this go-round.</p>

<h2 id='where_things_stand'>where things stand</h2>

<p>This is a clean slate. If you&#8217;re looking for old entries you simply won&#8217;t find them. They exist. They&#8217;re in a file backed up somewhere. They&#8217;re just not here. If you&#8217;re reading this the day I&#8217;m posting it then the appearance of this page is stock Wordpress. That&#8217;ll change one can assume.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m rusty. I&#8217;ve not kept up to date. I know there is an HTML 5. I have no idea if/how/what/why to do anything with that. I&#8217;m older. I have to jog my memory by looking at old template files from previous incarnations of restiffbard.com and glean what I can from them.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve bounced around from one CMS to another. Wordpress, Drupal, ExpressionEngine, and others whose names I can&#8217;t recall. They&#8217;ve been written in PHP, Perl, Ruby. They&#8217;ve all had their own way of templating things and it&#8217;s all a jumble in my head now.</p>

<p>It will take some time to work out the kinks.</p>

<h2 id='what_is_to_come'>what is to come</h2>

<p>More. Look for commentary on the web and Apple and Google and others. That I&#8217;ve always done. Look for tips and tricks. I&#8217;ve done a spot of that in the past as well. Also, look for me talking about games. I&#8217;d always talked about music and film in the past but I left out my baser addiction to games. It wasn&#8217;t for this audience. I forgot that I was a member of that audience.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll also talk more about my writing. I not only write these bits here but I, like nearly everyone else, have authorial aspirations. I need to talk about that too. Whole worlds live in my head and I&#8217;d like to offer you a peak at them if only to be able to get away, for one more day, with being completely insane and yet not in an asylum.</p>

<h2 id='what_have_we_learned'>what have we learned</h2>

<p>For starters, I&#8217;m back. Though I was never really gone. I had been creeping about on the periphery. It&#8217;s high time I stepped back on the stage. I&#8217;ve also forgotten some things. I&#8217;ve forgotten some markup, some styling. My memory will get me lost poking around the innards of a template these days. The most important thing I forgot, though, was the following.</p>

<p>I forgot I&#8217;m a blogger.</p>
