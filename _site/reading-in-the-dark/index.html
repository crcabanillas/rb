			<p>I just finished reading <em>Storm Front</em> the first book in the Dresden Files series by Jim Butcher. I won&#8217;t go into the merits of the book. I&#8217;ll just say, I enjoyed it a great deal and wish I&#8217;d read it years ago and that I&#8217;ll probably have the second book by this time tomorrow.</p>

<p>What I wanted to focus on was the manner in which I read the book. I knew of the Dresden Files series for some time, at least since the premiere of the television series on Sci-Fi (back when it was called that). Still, I didn&#8217;t get around to reading the book until my memory was jogged seeing Jim Butcher&#8217;s name go by at. That was enough to have me seek out the series on Netflix. For the next few days I watched at least one or two episodes each night before sleeping.</p>

<p>That wasn&#8217;t enough, though. Next stop, Amazon. Thankfully, the Dresden series is available in full for the Kindle. Nothing makes it more likely I will buy your book than Kindle availability. I don&#8217;t have anything against paper books. I simply don&#8217;t have the room. If you could see the monk-like cell I live in you&#8217;d wonder how I manage at all.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t use the Kindle device though I own a second generation Kindle. I prefer to use the app for iOS. My reasoning is simple. I can read a few pages during breaks at work on my phone. I know there are folks that say reading on a phone is painful or horrid or just something else unpleasant. I&#8217;m not one of those people. Oh, and my iPhone? It&#8217;s the first generation, the original iPhone. No retina display for me, no sir.</p>

<p>So, the last few days I&#8217;ve been reading the book mostly at work. Tonight, the story had just gotten too compelling. I had to read it through so I curled up in bed with my iPad and kept on reading. I&#8217;m not going to put a lot of stake in the fact that I was reading a book titled <em>Storm Front</em> while a thunder storm was banging away outside.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the interesting thing, by the glow of my iPad and with my attention so taken by the story, I failed to notice that the power had gone out.</p>
